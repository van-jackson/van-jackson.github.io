  I am a fourth year undergraduate student at University of California, Santa Barbara. I am a GIS major focused on data analysis. As of right now I am interested in population distribution and their relations to geographical features.

  Outside of school I work as a valet/bellman for a hotel in Newport Beach. My hobbies also include hiking, surfing, and rock climbing.
